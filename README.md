# vnStat Reports

This tool is a web interface to see the reports from vnStat. The features include the reports for a single interface connection and the reports that includes the sum of all the interfaces values. If you use both Cable and Wi-Fi connection on your notebook like me, you can see the total of traffic in all your connections.
